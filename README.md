This repo contains MDB mini-project 2, "Pokedex".

As the name suggests, the app is a Pokedex. Users may search for Pokemon based on name, number, types, or minimum stat points. They may also select twenty pokemon at random. After searching they are directed to a UICollectionView with their results. They may select any pokemon to see a page with all that pokemon's details. In this details page, users may favorite the pokemon or search for it on the web.
